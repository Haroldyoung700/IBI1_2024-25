P04179 · SODM_HUMAN
Organism: Homo sapiens
Subcellular location: mitochondrial
The amino acid sequence length: 222
The best alignment’s percentage identity corresponds to the top hit (P09671)
Blue residues: Fully conserved amino acids (identical in human and mouse SOD2).
​Grey residues: Similarity substitutions (amino acids with comparable physicochemical properties, e.g., glutamate → aspartate).
​Biological significance: Blue residues likely indicate critical functional/structural regions, while grey residues tolerate evolutionary variation.

Code Interpretation and Functional Overview
Sequence Loading & Validation​
Key Checks:
Verifies amino acid validity (e.g., rejects sequences with non-standard residues like Z or J).
Ensures sequence integrity (e.g., no truncation or corruption).

Random Sequence Generation​
​Function: Creates a negative control sequence with the ​same amino acid composition​ as the human SOD2 sequence but in randomized order.
​Rationale: Provides a baseline to compare evolutionary conservation (human vs. mouse) against random noise.

Alignment Scoring​
​Method: Uses the ​BLOSUM62 substitution matrix​ to calculate pairwise alignment scores.
​Metrics:
blosum_score: Sum of substitution scores for aligned residues.
identity_pct: Percentage of identical residues (direct matches).
alignment_length: Total compared residues (assumes sequences are of equal length).
​Non-standard Residues: Handles X (unknown) and * (stop codon) with default penalties.

Comparative Analysis​
​Three Pairwise Comparisons:
​Human vs. Mouse: Measures evolutionary conservation (expected high identity).
​Human vs. Random: Tests significance of conservation (random alignment should yield low scores).
​Mouse vs. Random: Additional negative control.
