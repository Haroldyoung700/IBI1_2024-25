For this semester's first three practicals, I've learnt a lot together with some shortcomes correcting. The following is my reflective feedback on the study process.
Practical3:
The aim is to learn linux operating system and website setup. For commitment, I finished the fundamental requirement but didn't reach the target of fulfilling the commitment information. So I re-submited all the text-editing and wrote detailed commitment message on my each commmitment. Also, I didn't make much effort on designing my website. So I re-designed my website and inserted a modern style of Academia
Practical4:
The aim is to learn basic Python knowledge. I completed this submission well while missed a detail. Since the portfolio requirements have stated that the truth table should be written as a comment. So I ran the programme and copy and paste the result as a comment in the programme as a pseudocode.
Practical5:
The aim is to learn approaches of importing dictionary and libraries. Fundamental requirements are reached while two problems remained: 1, The dictionary is defined, but the bar chart uses a separate hardcoded x and y instead of reading directly from languages. 2,The chart appears, but it lacks labels for title, x-axis, and y-axis, so it's considered incomplete.
So I edited the function to make it able to read from the defined dictionary. I also added x and y lable to fulfill my chart.

For the following practicals, I also re-examine the programmes and ensure the codes reach the requirements.
